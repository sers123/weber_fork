"""
Module containing Person data models for application.

This module defines two classes: PersonBase and PersonFull, both derived from Pydantic BaseModel.
These classes represent the structure of person data in the application, with PersonBase as a base model
containing common attributes like first_name and last_name, and PersonFull extending it by
adding an id attribute.
